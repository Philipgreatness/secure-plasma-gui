# Secure Plasma Transaction Monitoring Platform

A blockchain-powered solution for tracking and managing plasma transactions with enhanced security and transparency. The Secure Plasma GUI enables stakeholders to monitor, verify, and analyze plasma-related financial activities using immutable data storage on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Secure Plasma GUI provides a comprehensive system for:
- Real-time plasma transaction monitoring
- Advanced security and verification mechanisms
- Granular access control for sensitive financial data
- Comprehensive transaction history and audit trails
- Enhanced transparency in plasma-related activities

The system serves multiple stakeholders:
- Financial institutions can track plasma transactions
- Regulators can audit and verify transaction details
- Investors can monitor transaction flows
- Security teams can detect and prevent anomalies

## Architecture

The system is built on a single smart contract that manages interconnected data structures for agricultural tracking.

## Contract Documentation

### Data Structures

1. **Farmers Map**
   - Stores farmer details including name, location, and status
   - Indexed by farmer's principal

2. **Fields Map**
   - Records field characteristics and ownership
   - Tracks location, size, and soil type
   - Indexed by field ID

3. **Plantings Map**
   - Documents planting events with crop details
   - Links to specific fields and farmers
   - Indexed by planting ID

4. **Harvests Map**
   - Stores harvest data including yield and quality metrics
   - Connected to planting events
   - Indexed by harvest ID

5. **Verifiers Map**
   - Maintains authorized third-party verifier information
   - Specifies verification type and status

### Key Functions

#### Farmer Operations
```clarity
(define-public (register-farmer (name (string-ascii 100)) (location (string-ascii 100))))
(define-public (register-field (location (string-ascii 255)) (size-hectares uint) (soil-type (string-ascii 50))))
(define-public (record-planting (field-id uint) (crop-type (string-ascii 100)) ...))
(define-public (record-harvest (planting-id uint) (yield-amount uint) ...))
```

#### Verification Operations
```clarity
(define-public (register-verifier (name (string-ascii 100)) (verification-type (string-ascii 100))))
(define-public (submit-verification (target-type (string-ascii 20)) (target-id uint) ...))
```

#### Access Control
```clarity
(define-public (grant-data-access (data-type (string-ascii 20)) (data-id uint) ...))
(define-public (revoke-data-access (data-type (string-ascii 20)) (data-id uint) ...))
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet installed
- Stacks wallet for deployment
- Basic understanding of Clarity and Stacks blockchain

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with Clarinet
3. Deploy contract to testnet or mainnet

### Basic Usage

1. Register as a farmer:
```clarity
(contract-call? .harvest-pro register-farmer "John Doe" "California, USA")
```

2. Register a field:
```clarity
(contract-call? .harvest-pro register-field "North Field 1" u100 "Clay Loam")
```

3. Record planting:
```clarity
(contract-call? .harvest-pro record-planting u1 "Corn" u1234567 "Organic seeds" "Weather: Sunny")
```

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control
   - All sensitive operations require appropriate authorization
   - Data access can be granularly controlled
   - Only field owners can record plantings and harvests

2. Data Validation
   - Input validation for all parameters
   - Proper error handling for invalid operations
   - Sequential ID generation for various records

3. Verification System
   - Only registered verifiers can submit attestations
   - Verification history is immutable
   - Multiple verification types supported

## Development

### Testing
1. Run included test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

2. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

### Best Practices
- Always verify transaction sender authorization
- Maintain proper data relationships between records
- Use appropriate error codes for failed operations
- Keep data fields within size limits
- Follow organic/fair trade certification requirements when implementing verifications
